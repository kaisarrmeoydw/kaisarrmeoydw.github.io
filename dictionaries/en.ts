This is the corner of [Nooc](https://nooc.me).

Updated irregularly, sharing random thoughts, reading notes, and daily ramblings — but anything could appear.

### About Me

My online name is Nooc — not a real word, no special meaning. Like myself, not so conventional, and not seeking worldly definitions.

Active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/noobnooc), often sharing unfiltered thoughts. You can also reach me on [Telegram](https://t.me/noobnooc) or email [nooc@nooc.me](mailto:nooc@nooc.me).

Thanks to quantum mechanics, I was born somewhere between 1996 and 1997. An ordinary guy with nothing but dreams. I dream of becoming a nomad and traveling the world someday.

Since I can't be a physical carpenter, but love the \"design → build → polish → ship\" workflow, I call myself a digital carpenter. Hopefully one day I can make things I enjoy in the virtual world that also bring a smile to others.

My biggest hobby is starting things and never finishing them. I've tried drawing, video editing, photography, and MIDI — none stuck. The things I've consistently done are eating, sleeping, reading novels, and writing code. Hopefully writing will join the list.

I enjoy unique foods like houttuynia with cilantro, cold shredded potatoes, and various inventive concoctions.

I usually sleep between midnight and 8 AM in UTC+8.

Favorite authors include Márquez, Calvino, Wang Xiaobo, Woolf, Murakami, Mo Yan, Liu Liangcheng, and more. Some I've been meaning to read but haven't yet: Dostoevsky, Saramago, Proust, Vonnegut. Someday I'll enter their worlds.

I mainly write JavaScript/TypeScript, React/Next.js, Swift/SwiftUI — with a preference for Serverless.

When listening to music, I prefer random shuffle. I can never tell genres apart. Country, pop, rock, folk, blues? Not sure. Chinese, Japanese, vocal, instrumental, wild, quiet — I listen to everything.

If you like any of Jiang Wen, Wong Kar-wai, Hirokazu Kore-eda, Takeshi Kitano, Edward Yang, or Huang Xingyao — we're friends.

That's about it~
